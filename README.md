# Travel-Agency-Website
This is a Complete React Responsive Travel Agency Website Design using Styled Components. This is only front end design. JS and CSS are the main languages that I used.
Before starting to create this project I installed the yarn package as well as yarn styled component package.
To install the yarn package use this link https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable after that go to the Alternative section 
and click "click to expand" section.
You can choose your operating system and download it and install it.
To use styled component you have to install a styled-components package to your project. open your terminal and type "yarn add styled-components."
after installing those things you can start your project.
